Adds palm trees to, and improves the regional texturing of California in FlightGear!

To install, simply replace the default california.xml in FGROOT/Materials/regions with the one here, and add the texture file to FGROOT/Textures/Trees. Enjoy!

Much thanks to [Spikebrennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spikebrennan) at [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/), the author and copyright holder of [Palm trees in Santa Monica](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Palm_trees_in_Santa_Monica.JPG), for the source photo!

My only modifications were isolating the fifth palm tree from the left and applying transparency, followed by appending it to a tree texture file suitable for FlightGear using evergreen-mediterranean.png as a base.
