Adds palm trees to, and improves the regional texturing of California in FlightGear!

To install, simply replace the default california.xml in FGROOT/Materials/regions with the one here, and add the texture file to FGROOT/Textures/Trees. Enjoy!

## Licensing

Much thanks to [Spikebrennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spikebrennan) at [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/), the author and copyright holder of [Palm trees in Santa Monica](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Palm_trees_in_Santa_Monica.JPG), for the source photo!

My only modifications were isolating the fifth palm tree from the left and applying transparency, followed by appending it to a tree texture file suitable for FlightGear using evergreen-mediterranean.png as a base.

~~I have selected its **CC BY 2.5** license so to be able to license this repository under the FG-compatible GPL 2.0.~~

**EDIT** (June 2021): It has come to my attention that in fact, the artwork I have here is fuzzy with regard to GPL compatibility not only due to the version of the CC license with which I had attributed the photo, but also due to factors such as lack of reproducibility (or the need for it) by the community at large. This is why the contents of this repo were considered for an upstream push to FGdata, but it was ultimately decided against. Taking all this into consideration, I have now changed the licensing for this repo to the **CC BY-SA 3.0** option offered by the photo author (link in the button below).
